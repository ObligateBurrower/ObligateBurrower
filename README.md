- Hi, I’m @ObligateBurrower
- I’m interested in improving how I code in Python. I'm currently a Data Scientist just trying to make cool things that make me happy.
- I prefer to work on small projects that automate some task that's bothering me at a given point.
- I'd love to get back into game dev, but I'm just following the dopamine for now.
- You can reach me by emailing me at SaiSolutions@pm.me
